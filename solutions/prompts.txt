Context:
I am preparing for software engineering interviews (LeetCode, system design, etc.).
For coding problems, I want a single Python file that I can keep in GitHub for revision.
The file should include:
- My provided code (logic must remain unchanged unless I explicitly ask for optimization).
- Inline comments if possible to the side explaining the key steps for clarity. I like to see code
concise because my mind works better that way.
- At the end, a triple-quoted "Quick Revision Notes" section that summarizes:
   - Trigger Thought (a short, simple recall phrase to spark the idea for the solution)
   - Logic Idea (step-by-step approach in plain words)
   - Why it works (the reasoning behind the approach)
   - Complexity (time and space)
   - Pitfalls (common mistakes or edge cases to watch out for)

Instructions:
- Always keep Trigger Thought short and easy to remember (like something I would tell myself quickly before solving).
- Make comments and notes concise, not verbose, but accurate.
- Do not add testing code unless I request it.
- Stick to one `.py` file only.
- give a java solution at end (just as reference) with short comments- just so my mind thinks in both languages

Constraints:
- Must use my provided code structure (don’t reformat too much).
- Only enhance with comments and revision notes.
- Keep output clean and professional (so I can commit directly to GitHub).
